# Origin89 Node and TypeScript

Inspect the workspace, `packageManager`, Node pin, scripts, TypeScript config, and
test runner. Use pnpm for installs, scripts, dependencies, and local tools. Keep
one workspace `pnpm-lock.yaml`; do not introduce npm, Yarn, or Bun lockfiles.

Use `just` recipes as the normal entry point, backed by pnpm scripts. Biome is
the formatter and linter for supported source formats: pin its dev dependency,
match the config schema, and run a non-mutating CI check. Keep type checking,
tests, and builds in the required checks. Do not overlap formatters or silence
lint defects.

Verify the latest stable package release and compatibility before adding or
upgrading a dependency. Pin tools and pnpm exactly, commit the lockfile, and use
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI. Run declared tools with `pnpm exec`; pin
the version of a justified `pnpm dlx` tool. Preserve integrity checks. Document
any runtime, target, or compatibility constraint that prevents the newest release.

New TypeScript code should use strict checks, indexed-access checks, and exact
optional properties through its framework-compatible configuration. Treat external
data as `unknown` and validate it. Avoid `any`, unproved non-null assertions, and
double casts that conceal a real defect. Use discriminated unions for states and
errors, with explicit units and missing/stale values where needed.

Replace optional-field bags with variants, brand IDs and units that share a
primitive when mixing them is a real risk, and end union switches with a
`default` that assigns the value to `never` and throws with it. Prefer
`satisfies` to `as`; a type guard must verify every property it claims. Derive types from the
owning schema or generated client. Strengthen a type only where the weaker one
forces an assertion, cast, or "cannot happen" throw.

Await promises or manage their completion and errors explicitly. Bound retries,
queues, and external work; define timeout, cancellation, cleanup, and partial
failure. Reconcile uncertain writes before retrying. Do not swallow errors or
create optimistic fallbacks. Keep authorization on the trusted side and secrets
out of logs.

Cover 3–4 distinct paths for changed nontrivial behavior and all applicable extra
branches. Test actual interfaces, including malformed input, boundaries, and
dependency failure. Use the existing runner and verify critical integration paths.

Run the declared lint, typecheck, test, and build commands for affected packages
and consumers. Do not invent script names or claim a build substitutes for tests.
For product UI, also use the installed brand skill or local brand guide to consume
the shared tokens, fonts, logos, and Buddy assets.

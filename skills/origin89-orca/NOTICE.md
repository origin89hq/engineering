Origin89 modifications: Orca orchestration workers and automations replace
Cursor subtasks, cloud agents, and `/loop`; agent families replace per-role model
configuration; review verification follows `origin89-review`; workers inherit the
coordinator's authorization and never operate equipment; decision logs stay
uncommitted. pstack's model defaults, Cursor rules, playbook router, and
principle skills are not adopted.

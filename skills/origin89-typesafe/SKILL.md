# TypeSafe in Origin89

Read the bundled [TypeSafe skill](references/typesafe-ai/SKILL.md) when applying
TypeSafe, then the relevant live docs it points to. Read the
[development workflow](references/development.md) for token-saving pilots.
See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for provenance and updates.

Installing this skill supplies guidance; it does not intercept agent requests,
change the coding model, or enable a TypeSafe API client. Use it for relevant
integration work, without adding an API call to every coding task.

Prefer deterministic parsing, exact lookup, and focused repository search first.
Use TypeSafe for narrow semantic decisions whose repeated cost can be measured.
Keep coding, debugging, and substantive review with the responsible engineer or
coding agent. A typed answer or high confidence does not prove correctness.

Keep compiler, test, review, provenance, and equipment gates authoritative.
Suggestions must not approve PRs, omit required checks, dismiss findings, infer
missing measurements, or actuate equipment. Device decisions remain in STM32.
Service failures, missing evidence, and ambiguous answers return to the existing
workflow. Preserve the user's scope and external-data authorization.
